# Auto-Running Image Slider

![Alt text](./assets)

Welcome back to **Gevstack**, folks! In this project, we'll be creating an auto-running image slider using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This slider:
- Automatically displays different images every 10 seconds.
- Includes **Next** and **Previous** buttons to manually navigate between images.
- Loops back to the first image once the last image is reached.
- Has clickable **thumbnails** that allow you to jump directly to any slide.
- Is **fully responsive**, providing a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
